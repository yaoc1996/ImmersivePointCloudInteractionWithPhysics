# ImmersivePointCloudInteractionWithPhysics

### This unity project should run out of the box. Assets/StreamingAssets/ includes a sample point cloud (~88MB). 

### Other point clouds can be tested by changing the _directory variable in Assets/UnityPIC/Scripts/Tests2.cs. Note that _directory should point to the directory where cloud.js resides. This version supports Potree formats 1.7 and 1.8.

### The code for the RANSAC algorithm as well as the logic for hierarchical is also found in Assets/UnityPIC/Scripts/Tests2.cs
